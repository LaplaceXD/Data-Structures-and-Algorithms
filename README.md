# Data Structures and Algorithms

You'll find in this repo the different data strucutures and algorithms that I have taken, to expound on what
I know about programming. I also wanted to take this course because I feel like it is necessary, to become a
good developer.

I also wanted to use this as a chance to practice syntax with the languages that I currently know, thus
you'll be seeing the algorithms here written in three languages.
